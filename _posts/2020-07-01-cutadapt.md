##### Introduction

Cutadapt ***finds and removes adapter sequences***, primers, poly-A tails and other types of unwanted sequence from your high-throughput sequencing reads.

##### e.g. Trimming paired-end reads

```shell
cutadapt -a ADAPTER_FWD -A ADAPTER_REV -o out.1.fastq -p out.2.fastq reads.1.fastq reads.2.fastq
```

Input reads:  `reads.1.fastq` , `reads.2.fastq`

Result:  `out.1.fastq` , `out.2.fastq`

| Option                    | Result                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| -a ADAPTER                | [Regular 3’ adapter](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html#three-prime-adapters) |
| --max-n COUNT_or_FRACTION | Discard reads with more than COUNT `N` bases. If `COUNT_or_FRACTION` is a number between 0 and 1, it is interpreted as a fraction of the read length. |
| --minimum-length LENGTH   | Discard processed reads that are shorter than LENGTH.        |

##### Warning :要根据reads长度修改 --minimum-length参数
